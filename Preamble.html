		<p>After about fifteen months of investigation into my doctoral thesis
		I was forced, by the publication of an ample work based on my own
		reseach topic, to uncover new areas of investigation. I was looking into
		the idea of researching Diego de Arce y Reinoso, Inquisitor General,
		and looking for documents relating to him in the catalogue of the <em>Biblioteca
		Nacional</em> in Madrid. Finding a reference to him in the listing for BN
		MSS 2.276 I requested the item and thus &#8220;discovered&#8221; the correspondence
		presented here. The manuscript title is <em>Correspondencia del
		Ilustr&iacute;simo obispo de Sig&uuml;enza, don fray Pedro de Tapia,
		con don Francisco de Oviedo, secretario del Rey.</em> I hope that by
		making the correspondence available in this format it will become
		freely available to a much wider audience. It is a work which I feel
		complements in its depth of detail, if not its extension, the <em>Avisos
		de Barrionuevo</em> so well known by all historians of the reign of
		Philip IV.</p>
		<p>
		The correspondence comprises of a total of one hundred and seventy-nine
		letters and a copy of a memorial which friar Pedro sent to the Philip IV
		in 1646. Most of the letters originated in Madrid by Francisco de
		Oviedo, who wrote on the left-hand side of the paper. Friar Pedro wrote
		his reply on the right-hand side of the paper, answering most of
		Oviedo's points. Most of the letters occupied two sheets of paper. One
		hundred and fifty-three of the letters originated with Oviedo in
		Madrid, all of which, except twenty-three, are signed and dated by him,
		and it is this date which I have given at the start of each letter. Of
		the twenty-three letters which are not signed by Oviedo, twenty-two are
		dated by friar Pedro in his reply. In these instances this is the date
		given at the beginning of the letter and it is marked with a T to
		identify it. The reason these letters were not signed by Oviedo was
		that friar Pedro&#8217;s reply did not reach the third sheet of paper used and
		it had, therefore, not been returned to Madrid. The letters were written
		to catch the Aragonese <em>estafetas</em> which left Madrid on Saturdays
		and Wednesdays. There are thus two letters per week between December
		1645 and December 1647. The only breaks in this pattern were occasioned
		by friar Pedro&#8217;s visitations of his diocese between April and August
		1646 and May to July of 1647, and during friar Pedro&#8217;s illness towards
		the end of 1646. Unless otherwise indicated Oviedo was in Madrid and
		friar Pedro in Sig&uuml;enza. The numbers provided at the beginning of
		each letter I have added myself as a reference.
		</p><p>
		I have tried, as much as possible, to leave the original orthography
		and punctuation in order to retain the work&#8217;s authentic style. I have
		supplied notes to various words which I feel to be technical terms, old
		expressions, figurative language or those which may otherwise have
		initially confused me while reading the manuscript. The extent of these
		notations, however, is not exhaustive: I do not claim to be an expert on
		etimology. As an easy reference I have created hyperlinks on the names
		mentioned in the correspondence which link to biographical information
		(where available). It is also possible to find information with the
		biographical information of other instances in the correspondence when
		those people were mentioned. Where someone is mentioned more than once
		in a letter I have usually only linked the first mention.
		</p><p>
		There are a number of themes or topics which run throughout the letters
		which occur with considerable frequency. One of the most frequent of
		these is that relating to the financial administration of the diocese of
		Sig&uuml;enza and Segovia (occupied by friar Pedro until 1645). This
		latter administration is wound up in 1647. Another theme, directly
		relating to friar Pedro&#8217;s duties as bishop is his description of his
		work during his extensive visitations to his diocese. These occured
		between April and July 1646, taking friar Pedro at least 158km and to
		over fourteen towns and from May to July 1647 with a distance of 100km
		and visits to over eight towns. (<a href="/Appendices.html">See Appendix</a>)
		A further insight can be gained into what was involved in being a
		seventeenth-century bishop by looking at the consultative theological
		work friar Pedro carried out - we can see details of his
		correspondence, his attendence at meetings, his advice on moral matters
		and his work on his publications.
		</p><p>
		There are a couple of important themes in the correspondence which I
		have used to produce articles, on the reputation question in: &#8220;Los usos
		pol&iacute;ticos de la reputaci&oacute;n en la Corte de Felipe IV&#8221; and
		on the patronage system in: &#8220;Un h&aacute;bito para Luis: el
		funcionamiento del sistema de patronazgo en la Corte de Felipe IV&#8221;
		<a id="n1" class="sup" href="#footnote1">1</a>.
		Both of these articles address how important it was in the seventeenth
		century to consider the <em>public</em> aspect of all private events, an
		issue most evident throughout this correspondence. Nowadays we do not
		really have this distinction between the public and the private, we
		consider sin or virtue to be equally good or bad whether well-known or
		anonymous. In the seventeenth-century Catholic Monarchy the public
		knowledge of any sin created a scandal which incites &#8220;con su enfermedad
		contagiosa a los otros s&uacute;bditos.&#8221;
		<a id="n2" class="sup" href="#footnote2">2</a> Spreading private sin
		out into the body politic was unacceptable and it was always considered
		better to hide the sin away and for it to be unpunished than to punish
		it and thereby run the risk of public imitation of the sin. I consider
		this to be one of the fundamental reasons behind the insistence on
		secrecy in the Inquisition: not to stop people seeing in but to stop
		sin from spreading out. Likewise virtue needed to be extolled and the
		public knowledge of virtue was what was termed <em>reputaci&oacute;n.</em>
		The complexities of acquiring, maintaining and using a <em>reputaci&oacute;n</em>
		to enhance one&#8217;s political advantage can be seen clearly in the
		correspondence.
		</p><p>
		What I examined extensively in my doctoral thesis were the aspects
		revealed in the correspondence directly relating to the inner workings
		of a complex faction and the <em>modus operandi</em> of Luis de Haro. Much
		of the information relating to the workings of the faction is found in
		the discussions of the affairs of the Duke of Medinaceli, with whom both
		writers correspond. Many of the complexities of sailing a ducal house
		through the turbid waters of seventeenth-century politics are revealed
		here. It is also made self-evident the extent to which the age and
		personality of the incumbent influenced the success of his (or
		sometimes her) household. The liability or asset one&#8217;s relatives could
		become is also apparent as is the influence wielded by wives, mothers
		and daughters. The influence of Catalina Fern&aacute;ndez de
		C&oacute;rdoba is much more apparent in the marriage negotiations
		maintained for her children than is that of her politically ambitious
		husband Luis de Haro.
		</p><p>
		The correspondence will allow us to appreciate and come to understand
		opinions which may differ widely from our own and grasp the complex
		nature of the context in which they were held.
