			<h2>Pedro de Tapia</h2>
			<p>On the 18th March 1582, in the village of Las
			Villorias, in the region of Salamanca, the Licentiate Diego Altanero and
			his wife do&ntilde;a Isabel de Tapia, took their recently born son,
			Pedro, to be baptized. The location of the village of Las Villorias in
			the region of Salamanca was the aspect of friar Pedro&#8217;s parentage most
			favourable to the future fortunes of so gifted a son. This accident
			meant that friar Pedro went to study in the Dominican friary of San
			Esteban in Salamanca.
			</p><p>
			It was at San Esteban in 1602, at the age of 19, that friar Pedro took
			his vows to become a member of the Order of Preachers - the Dominicans.
			He was noted for his studiousness, and in 1617, he became the <em>Lector
			de Artes</em> at San Esteban. This was his first teaching position, and
			involved him in the instruction of novices. His teaching career was to
			occupy him for the next twenty-three years. In 1618 he was made <em>Lector
			de Teolog&iacute;a</em> in Plasencia, and in 1620 in Segovia. In 1622, at
			the age of 40, he moved to the friary of San Pedro Martyr in Toledo, to
			take up the position of <em>Lector de Artes y Teolog&iacute;a</em>. It
			was in Toledo that he became a <em>calificador </em>for the Inquisition
			of Toledo.
			</p><p>
			In early 1623 his teaching commitments took him out of the realm of
			monastic teaching, to teaching in a mainstream university. He was
			elected to the Vespers Chair at the University of Alcal&aacute; de
			Henares. The next seven years at Alcal&aacute; saw friar Pedro rewarded
			by his Order with the title of <em>Presentado</em> in 1626 and he was
			promoted to Prime  Chair in 1630. During this period at Alcal&aacute; he
			made the acquaintance of both friar Juan de Santo Tom&aacute;s, who
			taught philosophy and theology at the college of Saint Thomas in
			Alcal&aacute;, and friar Juan Mart&iacute;nez who was Prior of the
			college. All three lived in this college while at Alcal&aacute;. These
			were connections which were to prove of utmost importance in friar
			Pedro&acute;s later career.
			</p><p>
			Friar Pedro occupied the Prime Chair at Alcal&aacute; for ten years. In
			1640, despite his protests of unfitness for the post<a
			 id="n1" href="#footnote1" class="sup" >1</a>, he was elected
			to the episcopal see of Segovia. Richard Kagan estimates that the Prime
			Chair attracted a salary of 100,000 <em>maraved&iacute;s</em> a year.
			<a id="n2" href="#footnote2" class="sup" >2</a>
			The income from the bishopric of Segovia was 20,000 <em>ducados</em>
			(7,500,000 <em>maraved&iacute;s</em>) a year.<a
			 id="n3" href="#footnote3" class="sup" >3</a> The promotion of a
			lecturer of theology to a bishopric was not unusual. In fact, bishops
			were elected from three sources - the higher nobility, universities or <em>Colegios
			Mayores</em>.<a id="n4" href="#footnote4" class="sup" >4</a>
			For someone of friar Pedro&#8217;s obscure social origin, a position at a
			university was a pre-requisite for the job. Friar Pedro&#8217;s protests that
			the position involved too much responsibility were overcome by a letter
			from friar Antonio de Sotomayor, the Confessor Royal, and by his friend
			friar Juan de Santo Tom&aacute;s. The latter reassured him that he could
			continue to live in the style of a mendicant friar, even though he was a
			bishop.<a id="n5" href="#footnote5" class="sup" >5</a> 
			</p><p>
			This election to Segovia brought friar Pedro his first personal contact
			with the King.<a id="n6" href="#footnote6" class="sup" >6</a>
			He created a good impression. This, together with his reputation for
			holiness and sound doctrine, brought him the King&#8217;s favour. Due to the
			absence of an Archbishop of Toledo, and the proximity of Segovia to
			Madrid, friar Pedro played an active part in the funeral rites for the
			Queen, Isabel de Borb&oacute;n, in 1644.<a id="n7"
			 href="#footnote7" class="sup" >7</a> Lorea speculates that friar
			Pedro&#8217;s translation to Sig&uuml;enza was due to the King&#8217;s wish to have
			him near Saragossa. It was also due to the influence of friar Pedro&#8217;s
			friend, the Duke of Medinaceli, whose lands are located in the diocese
			of Sig&uuml;enza. The bishopric of Sig&uuml;enza had an income of 34,166 <em>ducados</em>
			in 1648<a id="n8" href="#footnote8" class="sup" >8</a>
			placing it behind only Toledo, Seville, Santiago, C&oacute;rdoba and
			Cuenca, as one of the richest sees in the Catholic Monarchy. Friar Pedro
			was elected to the see of Sig&uuml;enza in May 1643, but the bulls were
			not applied for until September 1644, and he did not enter into the
			bishopric until 1645.
			</p><p>
			In 1646 friar Pedro met the King and Prince in Atienza, near
			Sig&uuml;enza, on their way to Saragossa. In October of the same year,
			the King called him to Saragossa to help with the negotiations for a
			subsidy from the <em>Cortes</em> of Aragon. Friar Pedro arrived in the
			city on the second day of the illness of Prince Baltasar<a
			 id="n9" href="#footnote9" class="sup" >9</a> and was present at
			his death some three days later. In 1648 the King offered friar Pedro
			the archbishopric of Valencia<a id="n10"
			 href="#footnote10" class="sup" >10</a>, which he refused, according to
			Lorea, due to the supplications of his flock. Although an archbishopric,
			Valencia enjoyed an income some 15,000 <em>ducados</em> a year less than
			Sig&uuml;enza.<a id="n11" href="#footnote11" class="sup" >11</a> As
			it was also situated a long way from Madrid, it was not as
			strategically placed with regard to the Court.
			</p><p>
			Later in 1648 friar Pedro accepted the post of Bishop of
			C&oacute;rdoba. Toribio Minguella y Armedo says that he accepted this
			position due to the challenge that it offered.<a
			 id="n12" href="#footnote12" class="sup" >12</a> Since poor
			harvests in 1646, and the arrival of plague, Andalusia, as a region, had
			been in revolt. Lack of food and disease produced the inevitable riots,
			which, in 1652, friar Pedro played a large part in calming.<a
			 id="n13" href="#footnote13" class="sup" >13</a> 
			</p><p>
			In 1651, his fellow Dominican, Domingo Pimentel, renounced the
			archbishopric of Seville in order to go to Rome as ambassador. Friar
			Pedro was elected to the position and the papal bulls were received on
			23.9.1652. Shortly after this he made his entrance into Seville. He
			remained as Archbishop of Seville until his death on 5 August 1657, at
			the age of 76. It was during this period as Archbishop of Seville that
			friar Pedro published his only theological works. <em>Doctrina christiana</em>,
			which was written in Castilian, and two volumes entitled <em>Catenae
			moralis doctrinae - Doctrinas de cadena moral -</em> which were written in
			Latin.
			</p><p>
			Touron suggests that the Count-Duke of Olivares opposed friar Pedro&#8217;s
			appointment as Confessor Royal because of his rigidly orthodox views.
			<a id="n14" href="#footnote14" class="sup" >14</a>
			It is more probable that Olivares opposed him because of his political
			connections with Medinaceli and Quevedo. It is certainly true, however,
			that friar Pedro was a deeply religious and orthodox man. He was also
			exceptionally intelligent and possessed considerable political acumen.
			His character was one of extremes, not of compromise. He practised
			severe physical penances, not unusual in the epoch, lived in a bare
			cell, ate sparingly, and only during the last years of his life used a
			carriage instead of going everywhere on foot. In the last year of his
			life he wrote to his fellow Dominican, friar Juan Mart&iacute;nez, the
			Confessor Royal:
			me veo tan en los fines de esta larga navegaci&oacute;n
			... Que como es negocio tan grave, y que no se sentencia m&aacute;s de
			una vez, no es f&aacute;cil moderar el temor ... que en causa propria me
			ayuda muy poco el aver tenido C&aacute;tedra, y en todas deseo ser
			ense&ntilde;ado, y muy en especial de V. Reverend&iacute;sima a quien
			siempre e tenido muy particular respeto, estimaci&oacute;n y amistad.
			<a id="n15" href="#footnote15" class="sup" >15</a>
			</p><p>
			Apparently, the preaching of the art of <em>buen morir</em> did not help
			friar Pedro to overcome the natural human fear of death.

		<section id="Don_Francisco_de_Oviedo">	
			<h2>Don Francisco de Oviedo</h2>
			<p>Francisco de Oviedo was an obscure secretary to the King
			whose existence is only known because of his correspondence with Quevedo
			and friar Pedro. Don Francisco was born in the town of Casarrubios del
			Monte in the Tierra de Segovia. His parents, Luis de Oviedo and Beatriz
			de Espinosa, were also from Casarrubios. He married his cousin Ana
			Mar&iacute;a de Oviedo, the daughter of Antonio de Oviedo - brother of
			Luis - and In&eacute;s Su&aacute;rez. The three families of Espinosa,
			Su&aacute;rez and Oviedo must have formed a dynasty in Casarrubios, as
			they were all intermarried. Don Francisco&#8217;s cousin, Bernardo de Oviedo -
			son of Gonzalo de Oviedo - was, from 1612, also a secretary to the King
			<a id="n16" href="#footnote16" class="sup" >16</a>
			and lived with don Francisco in Madrid.
			</p><p>
			Don Francisco had an elder brother, Luis, who was granted a canonry in
			the Cathedral of Toledo. For reasons connected to his <em>limpieza</em>
			the Dean and Chapter of Toledo refused to allow Luis to take up this
			post. Luis protested against the &#8220;injustice&#8221; of this decision to the
			Pope. His case was upheld, so that on 5.5.1610 the Dean and Chapter were
			ordered to accept him, guard &#8220;perpetuo silencio&#8221;<a
			 id="n17" href="#footnote17" class="sup" >17</a> and pay the
			costs of the case. They, in their turn, protested. On 25.6.1612 &#8220;se
			present&oacute; una comisi&oacute;n contra el dicho Luis de Oviedo&#8221;.
			<a id="n18" href="#footnote18" class="sup" >18</a>
			In 1625 Luis died with the affair still unsettled, so his mother
			Beatriz, as inheritor of his estate, along with his brother Francisco,
			took up the case. On 9.5.1629 the papal court &#8220;pronunciaron su sentencia
			difinitiva a favor de los dichos Francisco y Beatriz.&#8221;<a
			 id="n19" href="#footnote19" class="sup" >19</a> The case,
			although favourable in its outcome, left a stigma on the <em>limpieza</em>
			of Francisco and his children. In 1647, when don Francisco applied for a
			habit of Santiago for his son, Luis Gonz&aacute;lez de Oviedo, he
			produced a summary of the case, along with lists of all his relatives,
			who had served as familiars of the Inquisition and Canons of the Church.
			Don Francisco and Ana Mar&iacute;a had three children - Luis, as already
			mentioned, Bernarda and Francisco.<a id="n20"
			 href="#footnote20" class="sup" >20</a> 
			</p><p>
			Don Francisco regularly corresponded with friar Pedro, the Duke of
			Medinaceli, and Francisco de Quevedo. Along with Medinaceli he was named
			as an executor of Quevedo&#8217;s will. He was also a friend of don Pedro de
			Pacheco Gir&oacute;n - Councillor of Castile and Inquisition, later
			President of Crusade - who was a patron of Quevedo.<a
			 id="n21" href="#footnote21" class="sup" >21</a> Through
			Medinaceli and Quevedo, don Francisco also knew the Duke of Infantado,
			to whom he passed messages from Quevedo, friar Pedro and Medinaceli.
			</p><p>
			Quevedo described don Francisco as having &#8220;la astucia de zorro viejo&#8221;.
			<a id="n22" href="#footnote22" class="sup" >22</a>
			He was considered by all to be a thoroughly competent and trustworthy
			man. From his letters he can also be seen to be well informed and
			intelligent, religiously orthodox, hardworking and moderate in his
			tastes. He always acted with meticulousness and thoroughness, rumours
			were reported as rumours, impressions as impressions and facts as facts.
			He provided an invaluable service for all his correspondents. He died
			shortly before 1663.</p>

		<section id="The_Duke_of_Medinaceli">
			<h2>The Duke of Medinaceli</h2>
			<p>The seventh Duke of Medinaceli was also referred to as the
			Duke of Medina or the Duke of Medina y Alcal&aacute;.<a
			 id="n23" href="#footnote23" class="sup" >23</a> It is by this
			first title that he is referred to by friar Pedro and don Francisco
			throughout their correspondence. Don Antonio Juan Luis de la Cerda was
			the only son of Juan Luis de la Cerda, sixth Duke of Medinaceli, and his
			second wife do&ntilde;a Antonia D&aacute;vila y Toledo, daughter of the
			second Marquis of Velada. The marriage took place in late 1606, shortly
			after the death of Juan Luis&#8217; first wife, Ana de la Cueva, the daughter
			of his step-mother and the Duke of Alburquerque. This marriage had left
			an only daughter - Juana de la Cerda - who married her cousin, the fifth
			Duke of Montalto. Their son, the sixth Duke, was married to the fourth
			Duchess of Alcal&aacute; de los Gazules y Bibona, Princess of Paterno,
			do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a Enr&iacute;quez de Ribera. Antonio Juan Luis
			was born on 25.10.1607 and his father died a month later on 24.11.1607.
			In 1623 Antonio Juan Luis contracted matrimony with do&ntilde;a Ana
			Mar&iacute;a Luisa Enr&iacute;quez de Ribera Portocarrero y
			C&aacute;rdenas, who was heiress to her cousin the fourth Duchess of
			Alcal&aacute; de los Gazules.
			</p><p>
			In 1641 Medinaceli was made Viceroy of Valencia. Before he left
			Cogolludo - a Marquisate of his near Medinaceli - he and his wife signed
			a contract of matrimony for their eldest daughter Antonia, with the Duke
			and Duchess of Infantado. Antonia was then five years old. The marriage
			was not to be as Rodrigo D&iacute;az de Vivar de la Vega y Luna de
			Mendoza y Sandoval<a id="n24"
			 href="#footnote24" class="sup" >24</a> , Count of Salda&ntilde;a, and
			heir to Infantado, died in 1646, at the age of ten. In 1643 Medinaceli
			was made Captain of the Atlantic and Coast of Andalusia, and moved to
			Puerto de Santa Mar&iacute;a to take up the position. This was a post
			traditionally held by the Dukes of Medina Sidonia, but denied to the
			ninth Duke following his attempt at treason.<a
			 id="n25" href="#footnote25" class="sup" >25</a> It was in
			Andalusia, two years later, that the Duchess of Medinaceli and
			Alcal&aacute; died. From this period the eldest son - Juan Francisco -
			became known as the sixth Duke of Alcal&aacute;.
			</p><p>
			The marriage had produced four children: Antonia Mar&iacute;a de la
			Cerda (1634) who married Gaspar de Haro, Marquis of Liche, Juan
			Francisco de la Cerda (1637), Tom&aacute;s Manuel de la Cerda (1639) and
			Ana Catalina de la Cerda (1641). The Dukes had entered into an agreement
			to marry their two sons to the two elder daughters of the Duke of
			Segorbe y Cardona and the Duchess of Lerma - a cousin of Medinaceli&#8217;s.
			Only the first of these two matrimonies took place, with Juan Francisco
			marrying do&ntilde;a Catalina de Arag&oacute;n y Sandoval - cousin to
			Gaspar de Haro - in 1652. Tom&aacute;s Manuel married the eleventh
			Countess of Paredes, Mar&iacute;a de Manrrique y Gonzaga. Ana Catalina
			married the son of the Admiral of Castile, Juan Tom&aacute;s
			Enr&iacute;quez de Cabrera. She died without issue. Thus through
			marriage the Medinaceli connection was linked with the highest
			aristocracy of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon.
			</p><p>
			Medinaceli maintained his position in Andalusia throughout the 1650s.
			He enjoyed considerable influence at Court and was a leading figure
			behind the Haro faction, having been made a Councillor of State in 1656.
			In 1665 he was made one of the executors to the King. Elliott describes
			Medinaceli as &#8220;a cultivated noble with a knowledge of Greek, Latin and
			Hebrew,&#8221;<a id="n26" href="#footnote26" class="sup" >26</a>
			who was fundamentally opposed to <em>validos.</em> He died on 7.3.1671 and
			was succeeded by his son, Juan Francisco Tom&aacute;s Lorenzo, famous <em>valido</em>
			of Charles II.

		<section id="The_Duke_of_Infantado">
			<h2>The Duke of Infantado</h2>
			<p>The fifth Duke of Infantado - don I&ntilde;igo de Mendoza -
			died without male heirs, his marriage having produced four daughters.
			The title thus passed to his eldest daughter, do&ntilde;a Ana de Mendoza
			de la Vega y Luna, who became the sixth Duchess. In an attempt to
			maintain the Mendoza lineage Ana first married her uncle Rodrigo de
			Mendoza, from which union was born a son, who died in infancy, and a
			daughter, do&ntilde;a Luisa de Mendoza de la Vega y Luna, Countess of
			Salda&ntilde;a. On the death of Rodrigo, Ana was induced to remarry,
			this time to her cousin, the son of the Marquis of Mond&eacute;jar, don
			Juan Hurtado de Mendoza, who is often referred to as the sixth Duke of
			Infantado.<a id="n27" href="#footnote27" class="sup" >27</a>
			Luisa de Mendoza married don Diego G&oacute;mez de Sandoval, the second
			son of the first Duke of Lerma and do&ntilde;a Catalina de la Cerda,
			great-aunt to Medinaceli. This marriage was an attempt by the Duchess of
			Infantado to gain the favour of the powerful Sandoval faction and thus
			recoup the fortunes of the House of Mendoza. The marriage produced two
			children who survived their teens - don Rodrigo D&iacute;az de Vivar de
			Mendoza y Sandoval and do&ntilde;a Catalina de Mendoza y Sandoval. Luisa
			de Mendoza died in 1627, and on 11.8.1633, on the death of his
			grand-mother, Ana, Rodrigo D&iacute;az de Vivar de Mendoza y Sandoval,
			at the age of 19, became seventh Duke of Infantado, and leader of the
			enormously influential Mendoza clan. Rodrigo and his sister Catalina
			were married on 10.2.1630 to the children of the Dukes of Pastrana,
			Mar&iacute;a de Silva and Rodrigo de Silva respectively, in another
			obvious attempt to maintian the Mendoza lineage of the Infantados. The
			Dukes of Pastrana were descendents of Ana de Mendoza, Princess of Eboli.
			The marriage between Rodrigo and Mar&iacute;a was emotionally, if not
			dynastically, successful - after producing two sons Mar&iacute;a was
			unable to have more children.<a id="n28"
			 href="#footnote28" class="sup" >28</a> 
			</p><p>
			The seventh Duke was hot-headed and eager to serve his country, an
			ambition not furthered by Olivares. In 1641 he became General of the
			Cavalry, a position much to his taste, and which he still held in 1646.
			<a id="n29" href="#footnote29" class="sup" >29</a>
			While very young he, along with the Duke of Pastrana, appear to have
			committed a number of fairly stupid youthful indiscretions.<a
			 id="n30" href="#footnote30" class="sup" >30</a> In 1649
			Infantado became the King&#8217;s ambassador to Rome, neatly he was removed
			from Court and prevented from being a nuisance.<a
			 id="n31" href="#footnote31" class="sup" >31</a> In 1651 he was
			transferred from Rome to Sicily as Viceroy. Infantado returned to Spain
			in 1656, with his wife Mar&iacute;a de Silva, suffering from an illness
			such that &#8220;no hay quien les conozca.&#8221;<a id="n32"
			 href="#footnote32" class="sup" >32</a> In January 1657 he was described
			as being &#8220;lleno de bubas&#8221;,<a id="n33"
			 href="#footnote33" class="sup" >33</a> symptoms similar to those of
			bubonic plague. He died four days later, to the great delight of his
			brother-in-law, the Duke of Pastrana, who entered immediately in his
			house to draw up an inventory of his papers. Mar&iacute;a was left to
			sue her brother for payment of her dowry, in order to have sufficient
			money to maintain herself.<a id="n34"
			 href="#footnote34" class="sup" >34</a> 
			</p><p>
			The duke of Infantado was a dynastic rather than a financial catch. The
			duchy had an income of some 120,000 <em>ducados</em> per year<a
			 id="n35" href="#footnote35" class="sup" >35</a>, but also
			debts of 800,000 <em>ducados </em>in <em>censos </em>in 1628.
			<a id="n36" href="#footnote36" class="sup" >36</a> In
			1644 the Duke complained of &#8220;the inadequacy  of all his rents to cover
			the interest on his debts.&#8221;<a id="n37"
			 href="#footnote37" class="sup" >37</a> This financial position led, in
			a large degree, to Infantado&#8217;s desire for a governmental post,
			consistently impeded by Olivares, which helps to explain his desire to
			overthrow the famous <em>valido</em>. For his contribution to the war in
			1646 Infantado received &#8220;doze mill d[ucado]s y otros quatro q[ue] le
			av&iacute;an de a&ntilde;adir de una encomienda y seis mill de aiuda de
			costa.&#8221;<a id="n38" href="#footnote38" class="sup" >38</a>
			After the war finished that year he was also given the &#8220;llave de la
			c&aacute;mara con exercicio.&#8221;<a id="n39"
			 href="#footnote39" class="sup" >39</a> Infantado left debts of 200,000 <em>ducados</em>
			which Cristina de Arteaga ascribes to his &#8220;mala administraci&oacute;n&#8221;.
			<a id="n40" href="#footnote40" class="sup" >40</a>
			Considering that he inherited debts of 800,000 <em>ducados</em> this
			assessment begs many questions.

			<h2>Juan de Santo
			Tom&aacute;s</h2>
			<p>Juan de Santo Tom&aacute;s was born on 6.7.1589 in Lisbon to
			the Austrian, Pedro Poinset and his Portuguese wife, Mar&iacute;a
			Garc&eacute;s. He had a younger brother named Luis. Both brothers
			studied at the University of Coimbra where they received the Bachellor
			of Arts in 1605. In October of that year Luis Poinset Garc&eacute;s
			stayed on at Coimbra to study law, while Juan went to the University of
			Louvain in Flanders to study theology. He graduated in 1608 as Bachellor
			of Biblical Studies. As a result of the influence of his master friar
			Tom&aacute;s Torres, OP, at Louvain, Juan decided to become a friar and
			took the Dominican habit at Our Lady of Atocha in Madrid in 1609.
			</p><p>
			He took his vows on 18.7.1610, and &#8220;abandon&oacute; la nobleza de sus
			apellidos&#8221;<a id="n41" href="#footnote41" class="sup" >41</a>
			to become friar Juan de Santo Tom&aacute;s, a true and humble disciple
			of St. Thomas of Aquinas:
			Deux conditions sont requises, dit-il, pour etre un vrai
			disciple de Saint Thomas; la premi&egrave;re, c&#8217;est de suivre sa
			doctrine comme vraie et catholique, la seconde, c&#8217;est de la
			d&eacute;velopper de toutes ses forces.<a
			 id="n42" href="#footnote42" class="sup" >42</a> 
			</p><p>
			Between 1613 and 1630 friar Juan taught theology and philosophy
			at the college of St. Thomas in Alcal&aacute;. It was here that he made
			the all important acquaintance of friar Pedro and friar Juan
			Mart&iacute;nez.
			</p><p>
			In 1630 friar Juan won the Vespers Chair at Alcal&aacute;, and in 1641,
			following friar Pedro&#8217;s appointment to the bishopric of Segovia, the
			Prime Chair. He held this position until 1643 when he was appointed
			Confessor Royal. As a condition of becoming Confessor Royal, friar Juan
			requested the King to be allowed to give his salary to the poor, and
			retain for himself and his companion, only the necessary to maintain
			themselves. Another condition of the appointment was that Philip IV
			should be sincere in wishing to live as a good Catholic. Friar Juan,
			from this position, attempted to reform the morality of the Catholic
			Monarchy. Olivares did not trust friar Juan, &#8220;whom he suspected of being
			the author of his misfortunes.&#8221;<a id="n43"
			 href="#footnote43" class="sup" >43</a> Friar Juan was opposed to <em>validos</em>,
			an opinion shared with Medinaceli, friar Pedro and sor Mar&iacute;a de

			</p><p>
			Friar Juan was recognized throughout the Monarchy as an extremely
			erudite Catholic thinker and holy man. He wrote an enormous number of
			books for one who died at the age of 56. His work contains eight volumes
			of commentary and explanation of Aquinas&#8217; <em>Summa theologiae.</em> The
			first three volumes were edited by him, the next four by his companion,
			Diego Ram&iacute;rez, and the eighth by Cambetis and Quetif.
			<a id="n44" href="#footnote44" class="sup" >44</a>
			He also wrote philosophical companions to Aristotle and Aquinas&#8217;
			commentaries on Aristotle. These can be divided into two groups: the <em>Ars
			Logica</em> and <em>Naturalis Philosophia</em>. He wrote three works in
			Spanish: <em>Explicaci&oacute;n de la doctrina cristiana, Ayudar a bien
			morir</em> and a guide to confessors, commissioned by the King in 1643.
			Acccording to Frances C. Wade &#8220;His detailed analysis of logical problems
			represents the top scholastic develop-ment of Aristotelian logic.&#8221;
			<a id="n45" href="#footnote45" class="sup" >45</a>

		<h2>Friar Juan Mart&iacute;nez</h2>
			<p>Juan Mart&iacute;nez occupied the position of Confessor
			Royal for over twenty years - one of the most lengthy occupations of the
			post - and yet he is almost absent from the history books. The dearth of
			information about him would lead one to assume that he was a somewhat
			mysterious and shady figure, but the lack has more to do with the
			ravages of time than the secretive nature of his character.
			</p><p>
			Juan Mart&iacute;nez - not to be confused with fellow Dominican Juan
			Mart&iacute;nez de Prado - was born in the Castilian town of El Corral
			de Almaguer in 1590. He took his vows, at the age of 16, in the
			Dominican convent of Santa Cruz el Real in Segovia, where he studied
			philosophy and theology. After teaching in San Esteban Salamanca and St.
			Thomas in Alcal&aacute;, he taught theology in Plasencia from where he
			was made Prior in Pamplona. He then taught theology in &Aacute;vila from
			where he was elected Rector of St. Thomas in Alcal&aacute;, where he met
			friar Pedro and friar Juan.<a id="n47"
			 href="#footnote47" class="sup" >47</a> He subsequently served as Prior
			in El Rosario in Madrid, St. Peter in Toldeo and St. Thomas in Madrid.
			In November 1643 he became a <em>calificador</em> for the Council of the
			Inquisition, and at this time he also became confessor to the Prince,
			Baltasar Carlos, and the Queen, Isabel de Borb&oacute;n. From this time
			until his death in 1675 he was resident at Court, where he enjoyed
			enormous influence.
			</p><p>
			In 1656 Barrionuevo commented the following of him:
			todos acuden a &eacute;l, y con sola una pluma que cada
			uno le deje, vendr&aacute; esta corneja a ser el ave m&aacute;s hermosa
			de todos y de m&aacute;s pluma.<a id="n48"
			 href="#footnote48" class="sup" >48</a> 
			</p><p>
			This is an obvious reference to Juan Mart&iacute;nez&#8217;s famed
			venality. He was an astute politician and from 1646 onwards he enjoyed
			considerable influence over the Council of Orders, and was in a position
			to influence Court patronage.
			</p><p>
			His post enabled him to gain a considerable personal income - both from
			official and unofficial sources. He used some of this income to found a <em>mayorazgo</em>
			in his home town, and build a house there for his nephew. He also gave
			1,000 <em>ducados</em> a year of his salary to a foundation for studying
			Scripture at Santa Cruz el Real.<a id="n49"
			 href="#footnote49" class="sup" >49</a> He also gave a <em>censo</em> of
			3,020 <em>ducados</em> of income to this foundation. The foundation of
			this chair gives some idea of Juan Mart&iacute;nez&#8217;s views of the
			Dominicans. The Dominicans were above all an Order of Preachers. They
			were meant to <em>preach</em>. However, most gifted entrants into the
			Order read scholastic theology and preaching was seen as a side duty.
			Mart&iacute;nez was not a gifted theologian and his aim with his
			foundation, apart from quashing rumours of his venality, was to increase
			the importance of the study of Scripture within the Order. 
			</p><p>
			Despite the retirement of Sotomayor in 1643 a Dominican replacement was
			not placed on the Council of the Inquisition, in spite of the Order&#8217;s
			right. Diego de Arce y Reynoso<a id="n50"
			 href="#footnote50" class="sup" >50</a> - the Inquisitor General -
			claimed that there were too many ecclesiastics on the Tribunal, and
			there was not enough money to pay for them. Furthermore he argued:
			lo segundo y m&aacute;s principal y q[ue] pide toda la
			atenci&oacute;n i cat[&oacute;lic]o zelo de V.M. es q[ue] los religiosos
			de la orden de S[an]to Dom[ing]o y los de la Comp[an&iacute;]a de
			Jes&uacute;s est&aacute;n divididos en dos escuelas contrarias y de
			conocida oposici&oacute;n a cerca de muchas opiniones.
			<a id="n51" href="#footnote51" class="sup" >51</a>
			</p><p> 
			This letter was sent to the King in July 1644 when the Dominican
			alternatives were presented as Francisco de Araujo - a contemporary of
			friar Pedro&#8217;s from San Esteban and retired <em>Catedr&aacute;tico</em>
			from Salamanca - Juan de Santo Tom&aacute;s and Juan del Pozo.
			</p><p>
			In this instance Arce&#8217;s wish was honoured, and again in 1646 when Juan
			Mart&iacute;nez had replaced Juan de Santo Tom&aacute;s on the list.
			Following the death of Sotomayor, however, Mart&iacute;nez&#8217;s influence
			with the King obviously overpowered Arce&#8217;s, and on 16.10.1648
			Mart&iacute;nez was elected to the Council. Arce&#8217;s opposition to the
			Dominicans was not overlooked by Mart&iacute;nez or friar Pedro, and,
			indeed, friar Pedro was careful to show his correspondence with Arce to
			Mart&iacute;nez, in order to avoid any misunderstandings.<a
			 id="n52" href="#footnote52" class="sup" >52</a> It must also be
			remembered that these five years of increased legal representation on
			the Tribunal and lack of a Dominican representative were the years which
			saw the spectacular re-trial of Ger&oacute;nimo de Villanueva.
			</p><p>
			Juan Mart&iacute;nez&#8217;s position as Confessor Royal was <em>technically</em>
			a religious one, but it was seen by him and by others as a political
			one. In his book <em>Discursos theol&oacute;gicos y pol&iacute;ticos </em>he
			wrote that in 1646 in Saragossa &#8220;por diferentes juntas, que all&iacute;
			tuvimos <em>todos los ministros</em> que asist&iacute;amos, y
			acom-pa&ntilde;avamos a Su Magestad&#8221;<a id="n53"
			 href="#footnote53" class="sup" >53</a> we decided business. In one of
			the later <em>discursos</em> of this book he discussed the question of
			whether theologians or jurists were better bishops, and came to the
			foreseen conclusion that theologians were best. There can be little
			doubt that this argument was in part aimed at his rival Diego de Arce y
			Reynoso, by far the better known jurist-made-bishop of his times.</p>

			<h2>Do&ntilde;a Catalina de Arag&oacute;n
			Fern&aacute;ndez de C&oacute;rdoba, Count-Duchess of Olivares</h2>
			<p>Catalina Fern&aacute;ndez de C&oacute;rdoba was the daughter
			of Enrique Ram&oacute;n de Arag&oacute;n Folch y Cardona, fifth Duke of
			Cardona and Catalina Fern&aacute;ndez de C&oacute;rdoba, the daughter of
			the fourth Marquis of Priego and Juana Enr&iacute;quez de Ribera, the
			daughter of the second Duke of Alcal&aacute;. She was thus a cousin of
			the Duchess of Medinaceli. Catalina was the sister of don Luis de
			Arag&oacute;n y Cardona, sixth Duke of Segorbe y Cardona, Vicente de
			Arag&oacute;n, Antonio de Arag&oacute;n and Pascual de Arag&oacute;n.
			<a id="n54" href="#footnote54" class="sup" >54</a>
			She was married to Luis M&eacute;ndez de Haro y Guzm&aacute;n in 1626 to
			further Olivares&#8217; political aims of the 1620s, which were to gain the
			influence of her father in his Catalonian lands.
			</p><p>
			Do&ntilde;a Catalina had four children who survived childhood. Gaspar
			de Haro y Arag&oacute;n, Marquis of Liche, who Barrionuevo claims to
			have had psycho-logical problems<a id="n55"
			 href="#footnote55" class="sup" >55</a>, and who tried to blow up the
			Retiro Palace.<a id="n56" href="#footnote56" class="sup" >56</a>
			He married first Antonia de la Cerda and then Teresa Enr&iacute;quez
			<a id="n57" href="#footnote57" class="sup" >57</a>
			with whom he had a daughter Catalina, who married the tenth Duke of
			Alba. Antonia de Haro y Arag&oacute;n, the eldest daughter, was married
			to the tenth Duke of Medina Sidonia, in an attempt to re-establish the
			fortunes of the house of Guzm&aacute;n. Juan Domingo de Haro y
			Arag&oacute;n married his cousin the seventh Countess of Monterrey, and
			Manuela de Haro y Arag&oacute;n married the Count of Luna. These
			marriages are to be explained by the political influence enjoyed by her
			husband, Luis de Haro.
			</p><p>
			During Haro&#8217;s absences from Court do&ntilde;a Catalina looked after his
			interests. In late 1645 Haro went to C&aacute;diz to supervise the
			arrival of the treasure fleets, and do&ntilde;a Catalina was left in
			Madrid to balance the Haro influence against that of his uncle,
			Castrillo. In order to help her in her work she employed a secretary -
			don Francisco de Oriar. It is obvious that she was an astute politician
			and enjoyed considerable personal influence. Her level of political
			influence led her into conflict with her father-in-law, the fifth
			Marquis of Carpio.<a id="n58"
			 href="#footnote58" class="sup" >58</a> She had considerable authority
			with her husband, along with a large degree of mutual affection.
			<a id="n59" href="#footnote59" class="sup" >59</a> 
			</p><p>
			Do&ntilde;a Catalina maintained a regular correspondence with friar
			Pedro since before 1645 until her death from a cancerous tumour,
			following childbirth, in November 1647.<a id="n60"
			 href="#footnote60" class="sup" >60</a> She was religiously orthodox and

			 href="#footnote61" class="sup" >61</a> She was an affectionate and

			 href="#footnote63" class="sup" >63</a> and Jos&eacute;
			Gonz&aacute;lez</h2>
			<p>Antonio de Contreras y Gonz&aacute;lez Bernaldo de
			Quir&oacute;s was from a very old Segovian family. He started his
			administrative career as the <em>Juez Mayor de Vizcaya</em> in the
			Chancery of Valladolid on 21.10.1617. He remained in this position until
			21.2.1622 when he was promoted to the <em>Contadur&iacute;a Mayor de
			Hacienda </em>as an <em>Oidor.</em> On 1.9.1630 he was elected as a
			Councillor of Castile in a supernumerary position and two years later
			was given the job of attending the Council of Finance as one of the
			observers from the Council of Castile. On 6.10.1638 he was made a member
			of the Chamber of Castile.<a id="n64"
			 href="#footnote64" class="sup" >64</a> 
			</p><p>
			Antonio de Camporredondo y R&iacute;o was from an equally old family
			from Soria. He went to the <em>Colegio Mayor </em>of San
			Bartolom&eacute; and in 1609, at the age of 30, was made an <em>Alcalde
			de Crimen</em> in the Chancery of Granada. He served as <em>Alcalde</em> for
			five years before being made <em>Oidor</em> on 30.6.1614, where he stayed
			two years before being transferred as <em>Oidor</em> to Valladolid. On
			29.3.1621 he was promoted to Court as an <em>Oidor</em> on the <em>Contadur&iacute;a
			Mayor de Hacienda</em> where he was joined by Antonio de Contreras a year
			later. On 6.5.1628 don Antonio was promoted to a supernumerary position
			as Councillor of Castile and in 1632, two months before Antonio de
			Contreras, he was made the observer of Finance sessions of the Council
			of Castile. In March 1639 Camporredondo was elected to the Chamber of
			Castile and throughout this period continued to serve on the Council of
			Finance, being made honorary President in 1643. He retired from Finance
			in 1648 at the age of seventy but continued in his other positions.
			<a id="n65" href="#footnote65" class="sup" >65</a> 
			</p><p>
			Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez was the son of an obscure lawyer from
			Arnedo. Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez himself also studied law. His career
			rise was much more meteoric than those of Contreras and Camporredondo,
			but it followed the same basic pattern. In 1624 he was elected to the
			position vacated by Diego de Ria&ntilde;o y Gamboa as <em>Fiscal</em> to
			the Chancery of Valladolid, and two years later was promoted to Court as
			the <em>Fiscal </em>to the <em>C&aacute;rcel de Corte.</em> (16.11.1626)
			He served there for just over a year until on 8.1.1628 he was made <em>Fiscal</em>
			to the Council of Castile, and a year and nine months later was given a
			supernumerary position on the Council. Three years later his rise was
			complete, having been made a member of the Chamber of Castile on
			1.5.1632.<a id="n66" href="#footnote66" class="sup" >66</a> 
			</p><p>
			Don Francisco Antonio de Alarc&oacute;n&#8217;s career was less dramatic than
			Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez&#8217;s. He was made the <em>Alcalde de Hijosdalgo</em>
			in Valladolid in 1613, from where he was promoted to <em>Oidor</em> in
			Granada to occupy the place vacated by Camporredondo in 1616. In 1622/3
			he went to Naples on the King&#8217;s business - a sure sign of impending
			promotion - and on his return on 17.2.1624 he was given a supernumerary
			position on the Council of Indies, where he would have made the
			acquaintance of don Garc&iacute;a de Haro, future Count of Castrillo. In
			1628 Alarc&oacute;n was again sent to Naples and as a result was given a
			position on the Council of Castile (16.3.1628) on his return. On
			13.9.1634 Alarc&oacute;n was made a member of the Chamber of Castile. In
			1643 he was made Governor of Finance and in 1644 President. He was to
			die occupying this post three years later in November 1647, to be
			replaced by Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez.<a id="n67"
			 href="#footnote67" class="sup" >67</a> 
			</p><p>
			These four figures were the financial &#8220;genii&#8221; of the reign of Philip
			IV. The state of the Catholic Monarchy&#8217;s finances does not testify to
			their great success. In 1638 they sat on the <em>Junta de la Moneda</em>
			and in 1650, along with the Count of Pe&ntilde;aranda - Gaspar de
			Bracamonte<a id="n68" href="#footnote68" class="sup" >68</a>
			- they sat on the <em>Junta de Medios.</em> Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez
			served as President of Finance from 1647 until 1651, when Antonio de
			Camporredondo was brought out of retirement to re-occupy the office.
			(1651-2)
			</p><p>
			Both Gonz&aacute;lez and Camporredondo founded <em>mayorazgos</em> for
			their children, Camporredondo founded a <em>mayorazgo</em> with an income
			of 1,000 <em>ducados</em> per year for his son Antonio who also followed
			him in an administrative career, receiving his first position as <em>Fiscal</em>in
			Valladolid in 1641.<a id="n69"
			 href="#footnote69" class="sup" >69</a> Gonz&aacute;lez founded a <em>mayorazgo</em>
			for his son, and his daughter-in-law, on her death, left a fortune of
			1,138,434 <em>reales </em>(103,494<em>ducados</em>).<a
			 id="n70" href="#footnote70" class="sup" >70</a> When compared
			to the fortunes of the higher nobility, even the fortune accumulated by
			Gonz&aacute;lez is moderate. Although it is undeniable that
			Gonz&aacute;lez significantly improved his financial position during
			office, there is really no comparison between his fortune and those
			accumulated by, for example, Osuna, Olivares and Monterrey. Councillors
			of Castile earned 55,000 <em>reales </em>(5,000 <em>ducados</em>) a year.
			Presidents of the Councils of Indies and Finance earned 100,000 <em>reales</em>(9,090<em>ducados</em>)
			a year. This may be compared to the 22,000 <em>ducados </em> paid to
			Infantado for his part in the war in Catalonia, and the 266 <em>ducados</em>
			a year paid to University Professors.<a id="n71"
			 href="#footnote71" class="sup" >71</a> 
			</p><p>
			Janine Fayard states that &#8220;el m&aacute;s fiel amigo de Jos&eacute;
			Gonz&aacute;lez fue su colega del Consejo D. Antonio de Contreras, con
			quien particip&oacute; en numerosas juntas.&#8221;<a
			 id="n72" href="#footnote72" class="sup" >72</a> Friar Pedro had
			a close correspondence with Antonio de Contreras and used his influence
			to help Oviedo obtain a habit  of Santiago for his son Luis. Contreras
			and Camporredondo shared similar religious views, and were both in
			favour of the ban on comedies. 
			</p><p>
			Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez - the <em>eminence gris</em> of Olivares -
			maintained, as did the other three men, his influence after the fall of
			his previous mentor. If anything, his influence increased after
			Olivares&#8217; fall, all of which points to the basic stability and
			continuity of the administration throughout the reign of Philip IV.
			Gonz&aacute;lez, Camporredondo and Contreras were all remarkable for
			their extreme longevity.

			<h2></a>The Count of Castrillo</h2>
			<p>Don Garc&iacute;a de Haro was the second son of the fourth
			Marchioness of Carpio, do&ntilde;a Beatriz de Haro. His brother, don
			Diego de Haro, the fifth Marquis, was the brother-in-law of Olivares.
			Don Garc&iacute;a, as a younger son, was sent to university - he was a <em>colegial</em>
			of Cuenca in Salamanca - in order to prepare him for an administrative
			career. Armed with his doctorate, he obtained a position as <em>Oidor </em>in
			Valladolid on 19.3.1619. There he served with Antonio de Camporredondo,
			Antonio de Contreras and Diego de Ria&ntilde;o y Gamboa. While in
			Valladolid he formed a relationship with the daughter of one of the
			other <em>o&iacute;dores</em> - Christ&oacute;val de Paz - who was a
			divorcee. With Jer&oacute;nima de Paz he had an illegitimate son - Luis
			de Haro y Paz.<a id="n73" href="#footnote73" class="sup" >73</a>
			In 1623 don Garc&iacute;a&#8217;s powerful connections procured him a place on
			the Council of Orders and on 17.2.1624 a supernumerary position on the
			Council of Castile. In 1625 he was elected to the Chamber of Castile and
			began to be known as don Garc&iacute;a de Haro y Avellaneda. This change
			of name was due to his impending marriage with the third Countess of
			Castrillo, do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a de Avellaneda Enr&iacute;quez de
			Portocarrero which took place in 1629. Shortly before the wedding don
			Garc&iacute;a began to appear in the papers of the Chamber of Castile as
			don Garc&iacute;a de Avellaneda y Haro. In 1626 don Garc&iacute;a was
			made temporary Governor of the Council of Indies and between 1628-1632
			was elected to the Councils of State and War. On 27.11.1632 he was made
			permanent Governor of Indies now using the title of Count of Castrillo.
			<a id="n74" href="#footnote74" class="sup" >74</a>
			The income from don Garc&iacute;a&#8217;s estates was very moderate: around
			8,000 <em>ducados</em> a year. In 1622 he obtained the habit of Calatrava,
			and in 1634 a habit of Santiago for his illegitimate son, Luis.
			<a id="n75" href="#footnote75" class="sup" >75</a>
			</p><p>
			Don Garc&iacute;a was a frequent member of <em>juntas </em>on which he
			served along with Jos&eacute; Gonz&aacute;lez, Antonio de Camporredondo,
			Antonio de Contreras and Francisco Antonio de Alarc&oacute;n. During the
			King&#8217;s absence from Court in 1641-1642, Castrillo remained at Court as
			an assistant to the Queen. He was instrumental in the overthrow of
			Olivares in 1643. He hoped that his cultivation of the Queen&#8217;s favour
			would bring him power, but on her premature death in 1644 he was forced
			to share power with his nephew, don Luis de Haro, always the more
			popular minister due to his more flexible character. From 1647 he
			maintained a correspondence with friar Pedro, who described him as an
			&#8220;inteligente y antiguo&#8221;<a id="n76"
			 href="#footnote76" class="sup" >76</a> minister.
			</p><p>
			Upon the death of Haro in 1661, Castrillo became the head of the Haro
			faction, sharing power with the Count of Pe&ntilde;aranda - an old
			associate - and the Duke of Medina de las Torres, don Ram&oacute;n
			Fel&iacute;pez Nu&ntilde;ez de Guzm&aacute;n. Between 1662 and 1668
			Castrillo occupied the position of President of Castile, although

			<h2>Don Luis M&eacute;ndez de Haro y
			Guzm&aacute;n.</h2>
			<p>Don Luis M&eacute;ndez de Haro y Guzm&aacute;n was the
			eldest son of Diego de Haro, fifth Marquis of Carpio, and do&ntilde;a
			Francisca de Guzm&aacute;n, sister of the Count- Duke of Olivares. He
			had a younger brother Enrique. He became Duke of Montoro following the
			peace of the Pyrenees, and, on the death of Olivares, inherited from him
			the titles of Count of Olivares and Marquis of Liche. His son, don
			Gaspar, used the title of Marquis of Liche, while his wife became known
			as the Duchess Countess of Olivares, forcing Olivares&#8217; widow,
			In&eacute;s de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, to use the title of Duchess of San
			L&uacute;car. This latter title, after lengthy litigation, was inherited
			by Olivares&#8217; ex-son-in-law, the Duke of Medina de las Torres.
			<a id="n77" href="#footnote77" class="sup" >77</a> 
			</p><p>
			Medina de las Torres had been married to do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a de
			Guzm&aacute;n, Marchioness of Liche, to the chagrin of Haro, who, it was
			supposed, would become her husband. This started a rivalry between the
			two which &#8220;culminated in 1664, in the grand romantic fashion of a fatal
			duel between one of Medina&#8217;s sons and a grand-son of Castrillo.&#8221;
			<a id="n78" href="#footnote78" class="sup" >78</a>
			Through the influence of his uncle Olivares, Haro married the daughter
			of the Duke of Cardona. The Cardona family maintained a traditional
			rivalry with the family of Enr&iacute;quez de Cabrera - the Dukes of
			Medina de R&iacute;o Seco, Admirals of Castile. To this rivalry Haro
			brought the Guzm&aacute;n influence. In the late 1620s, through his
			uncle, Haro was made <em>gentilhombre de la boca.</em>
			</p><p>
			After the fall of Olivares in 1643 Haro enjoyed an increase in
			influence at the Court of Philip IV. He maintained, as Olivares before
			him, daily audiences. This led him to be referred to as the new <em>valido</em>,
			although he was never officially named as such. Haro controlled many <em>juntas</em>
			at Court, most significantly the <em>Junta de Estado</em>. It was not,
			however, until 1648, with the death of his father, that he inherited a
			formal position at Court: that of <em>caballerizo mayor.</em> Stradling
			describes him as &#8220;a kind of co-ordinator, responsible in policy to the
			Council of State, through the King.&#8221;<a id="n79"
			 href="#footnote79" class="sup" >79</a> Increasingly from 1655, until
			his death in 1661, he became more and more unpopular.
			</p><p>
			Luis de Haro was described in almost all correspondence as having a
			smooth charm and strict regard for etiquette and protocol. Friar Pedro
			described him as &#8220;del buen talento y agrado y buena atenci&oacute;n&#8221;.
			<a id="n80" href="#footnote80" class="sup" >80</a>
			Stradling claims that Haro had to dissimulate his desire to become <em>valido</em>,
			which he did with consummate skill, in order to appease the group of
			nobles - Medinaceli, Infantado, etc. - who had propelled him into power.
